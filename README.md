# HangMan

The 'HangMan' game is created using the C++ programming language. We aim to demonstrate it with an easier and innovative design. A structure is used to compare the strings of the word and the guess. The userâ€™s guess will iterate over the characters in a for-loop, and check if there is a match or not.
